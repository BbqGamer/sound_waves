Sound Waves

C++ Educational Project about sound files

Technikum Komunikacji Pozna≈Ñ Polska

Program is designed to manipulate with .wav files.

You give input files to folder /inputSamples and receive output in /outputSamples.
in outputsamples you can find some examples of processed wav files


Compile program to start console interface,
choose certain options to test a feature:

ex. Choose 1 and click enter to test Amplifier feature.
It prompts for file name. choose one of input files. (eg. melody, airplane).
Then it prompts for output file name wchich is your desired name (eg. melody-amplified).

Lastly it asks for value with wchich signal has to be amplified or attenuated.
(Values below one diminish signal, and below make it stronger). (eg. 1.5 - changes all values 1.5 times)
(check AirplaneAmplified)


Two other features are BitReduction and Downsample which are inspired from Ableton Plugin Redux. 

BitReduction is commonly used in electronic music, for example by giving some juice to a bassline.
Input value is desired post FX bitDepth. (check BassLineReduced)

Downsample can be used to simulate sound from old standards that had smaller sample rates, for example from old CD's where sample rate was about 4 to 8 times lower than in todays standards. (check melodyDownsampled)
